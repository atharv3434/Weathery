This Interactive Weather Application is a dynamic web-based tool that allows users to check current weather conditions in their chosen city. The app is designed to be visually appealing, easy to use, and provides real-time data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API. With an emphasis on both functionality and aesthetics, the application offers a unique weather experience by dynamically changing the background image based on the weather condition and displaying relevant weather data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
